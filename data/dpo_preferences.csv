"""Alexa add small bananas to the shopping list."" I've added smooth armours to your shopping list."" Gee thanks Alexa! #alexa","No

Reasoning: The user is expressing gratitude for adding small bananas to their shopping list, which implies they found it funny that Amazon didn't recognize them as smooth armors when they were asked if they had purchased smooth armors before. The sarcasm here lies in the fact that they seem to be making fun of the product being asked about, rather than being offended by it.","No

Reasoning:
This message is clearly mocking Alexa for making requests she doesn't understand or agree with, which would be considered sarcastic. The use of capital letters and exclamation points also adds emphasis, further supporting its intended sarcasm.",1
Andrews really trying to explain to me that football and rupauls drag race aren’t the same thing when it in fact is the same thing.,"No

Reasoning:
This statement is an example of sarcasm because it highlights the contradiction between Andrews's interpretation of the relationship between football and Ruppert's rap game, which he claims are identical, but actually they are different concepts. The phrase ""the same thing"" also implies that these two things can be understood as equivalent, further emphasizing the discrepancy and irony present in the original text.","No

Reasoning: The user is pointing out a difference between a ""football and rupauls drag race"" and an actual ""drag race,"" suggesting they think these two terms are different.",1
"Investing doesn’t need to be complicated. Invest in a low cost global index fund or ETF over the long-term, have PAYtience and watch your money grow!","No

The text seems like it's suggesting that investing isn't necessarily complicated if you're looking at long-term investments rather than daily transactions, and it recommends focusing on a diversified portfolio and paying attention to taxes. This kind of advice might sound cynical if applied to everyday trading but is actually very common advice given to investors.","No

The statement appears to be offering advice on how to invest wisely, which is generally seen as more of an ethical investment approach than outright advice on specific investments.",0
Gonna go cry now some no face told me to lose weight x,"No

Reasoning:
The use of the phrase ""Gonna go cry now"" clearly indicates sarcasm and anger at being told to lose weight, which fits the context of someone going into extreme physical pain (cry) before agreeing to a plan they're told they should do because of past experience (going cry).","No

Reasoning: The quote ""Go cry now"" implies that the person was feeling very sad and angry at being told not to diet, which is an extreme reaction to something they perceived as unfair treatment. In such situations, people tend to exaggerate or express their emotions more strongly to justify their actions. This is why sarcastic statements like ""Gonna go cry now"" can be seen as ironic or exaggerated.",1
finding vegetarian chocolate mousse is such an annoyingly hard task to do,"No

Reasoning: The phrase ""such an annoyingly hard task"" suggests it's a difficult job that requires significant effort, which implies sarcasm rather than irony or exaggeration.","No

Reasoning:
The use of ""such"" in this context suggests that the phrase was meant literally and should not be interpreted as an exaggeration or a negative statement about the difficulty of finding vegetarian chocolate mousse, which would likely be more commonly used in everyday language when referring to difficult tasks or situations. The wordplay here could be interpreted in a humorous way, but it's also common for sarcasm to come from using words or phrases that carry multiple meanings. 

In this case, the",0
"Yes, it's unfortunate that we are in lockdown again - however, this blame mentality isn't helping anyone. With everything we've experienced during lockdown, we shouldn't move forward with divisive and unkind comments but instead with unity and compassion 💕 #leicesterlockdown","No

Reasoning: The author uses sarcasm to criticize the blame mentality towards the virus and its impact on society rather than offering any solutions or constructive criticism about how to handle the situation effectively. They seem to be focusing solely on pointing out negative aspects without providing meaningful advice or addressing the issues they raise.","No

Reasoning:
The author is expressing frustration and blaming others for the current state of affairs, which is clearly not supportive of unity and compassion. The tone suggests an attempt to justify their own actions rather than engaging constructively with issues.",0
It’s Wednesday I’m in love,"No

Reasoning: The phrase ""It's Wednesday"" implies that something specific or significant is happening on that particular day, which doesn't align with sarcasm as it suggests a general trend or mood rather than reacting to something specific.","No

Reasoning:
The use of ""I'm in love"" with the word ""Wednesday"" suggests it's not just some whimsical statement but rather a literal statement about someone being on Wednesday. This implies that the person is genuinely in love with their date at that specific time of day, which isn't inherently sarcasm but rather an unusual or exaggerated expression of emotion. The use of ""me"" instead of a name further reinforces this interpretation as the speaker seems to be using this phrase for personal",0
"I love drawing feets 👹👹👹
Must draw more feet 👹✨","No

Reasoning: The user mentions they ""love drawing feet"", which implies admiration for the feet in question (presumably an artist), and then says ""Must draw more feet"" again, implying that they want to draw more than they already have. This clearly indicates sarcasm.","No

Reasoning:
- The author is expressing appreciation for drawing feet.
- However, this doesn't necessarily indicate sarcasm as it's also common to express admiration for drawings in general.
- Therefore, it can be considered a normal expression of appreciation without necessarily being sarcastic.

So, my answer is: No.",0
I would like to dedicate my hot girl summer to the Eastpointe Chick-Fil-A. Thank you!,"No

Reasoning:
This message is clearly mocking or insulting someone's sexual preference or behavior, which can be considered sarcasm due to its extreme nature and direct accusation against it.","No

Reasoning: The speaker uses hyperbole (""I would like to dedicate my hot girl summer to"") while also using sarcasm (""thank you! "") which creates an ironic effect suggesting that their intention was not clear enough in their statement. However, this doesn't negate the sarcastic nature of the phrase itself.",1
"Fuck, an Insomniac developed Wolverine game?!  Someone REALLY wants me to get a PS5.

Probably the corporations *sigh*","No

Reasoning: The quote implies that someone has taken a step in the right direction by developing games for the PS5, but it's not clear if they're trying to be politically correct or just plain being sarcastic. The tone suggests a sense of frustration or disappointment at having to play games on a different platform than one desires, which aligns more with sarcasm rather than a true political stance.","No

Reasoning:
This statement is clearly mocking and sarcastically accusing the person speaking of wanting to purchase a PlayStation 5 (""Fuck"" to indicate they have a negative opinion), implying that it's a violation of their personal desires or wishes to own a gaming system. It also sounds like a statement of fact, which would be expected in a sarcastic response. The tone is intentionally dismissive and critical, making it clear that the author has no positive feelings towards owning a PlayStation 5 himself.",0
the absolute worst part of my job is the fact that i have to call people on the phone :|,"No

Reasoning:
This statement is clearly mocking and sarcastically pointing out the negative aspects of their job (the need to call people on the phone), which is an ironic way of expressing frustration. The use of ""absolute"" emphasizes how extreme it feels in this context.","No

Reasoning: The phrase ""the absolute worst part"" indicates sarcasm and implies a negative aspect of the job described in the text.",0
being a head nodder in zoom university is a curse,"No

Reasoning: The phrase ""being a head nodder in zoom university is a curse"" implies that the speaker finds such behavior to be offensive or inappropriate, which is a clear sign of sarcasm. The use of ""head nodder"" also suggests a negative connotation, further emphasizing the intended irony.","No

Reasoning:
This statement uses an ironic reference to someone else's experience at Zoom University, which makes it sound like they would have difficulty with the platform, rather than just being a ""head nodder."" It also contains sarcasm through the ""curse"" that follows, implying that the person speaking might not be able to fully utilize the platform because of their background. The humor comes from this unexpected twist on a common stereotype about the Zoom experience.",0
Tell u what it’s sooo nice to see things getting back to normal 🥺🥺,"No

Reasoning:
This message is clearly mocking or deriding the current state of affairs, making it an example of sarcasm rather than irony or exaggeration.","No

Reasoning: The use of hyperbole (""sooo nice"") suggests that something is extremely positive and good, which aligns with sarcasm, implying they want to see things return to normalcy as well.",0
Humans are the only animal that can’t tell fantasy from reality,"No

Reasoning:
This statement is an extreme form of hyperbole, using fantastical language to imply that humans cannot distinguish between reality and imagination, which is absurd given our ability to create fictional worlds and stories in real life.","No

Reasoning: The statement implies that humans lack the ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality, which is contradictory and could be seen as sarcasm.",0
I forgot my keys omds I had to message my brother on roblox to open the door,"No

Reasoning: The user mentions they forgot their keys, which could be seen as a mild hint that the situation might not be perfect (or at least not one they expected), but also implies there's an issue with their physical possession rather than a problem with their mind. Therefore, this seems like a typical sarcastic response.","No

Reasoning:
The statement ""I forgot my keys"" doesn't necessarily indicate an attempt at sarcasm because it's more about forgetting something, which could be a normal human reaction. The user then goes on to mention sending a message to their brother in Roblox to open the door, indicating they were expecting someone to come over to help them.

Therefore, this appears to be just another way of expressing forgetfulness or inability to contact anyone, not indicative of sarcasm.",0
trying to figure out how to use notion for my anime list. I think i’m dying,"No

Reasoning:
The user is expressing frustration because they can't find the way to use Notion for their Anime List project. The sarcasm comes from implying that using it wouldn't work properly or being unable to understand the command instructions due to not understanding their own codebase.","No

Reasoning: The user mentions they're ""dying,"" which suggests they're struggling in some way, likely related to using a software like Notion for managing their anime lists. This implies that they might not be happy about it, hence the sarcasm.",1
&amp;&amp; If I see one more tweet about someone confusing Joe Budden and Joe Biden I’m really gonna lose it bc the election is around the corner people. Get it togetha (U.S people),"No

Reasoning:
This statement is clearly mocking or deriding the use of names like ""Joe"" and ""Joe Biden"", which have become common in popular culture and politics due to their association with Democrats and former Presidents. The sarcasm lies in suggesting that this will result in losing one's job because of this name association.","No

Reasoning: The quote expresses frustration at seeing negative reactions to an already divisive issue, likely related to the recent controversy over Joe Biden's presidential ambitions. It suggests a strong desire for clarity and unity, which aligns with sarcasm rather than irony or exaggeration.",0
"So we actually have to do hot girl summer without 1989 Taylor’s version., I’m sick","No

Reasoning:
This statement is clearly mocking or deriding the use of Taylor Swift's songs in certain contexts, particularly during specific times when she may not be as popular (in this case, ""hot girl summer""). The sarcasm lies in suggesting that even if the song is ""hot"", it can still lead to negative reactions because of its popularity at a particular time. This implies an anti-singer sentiment towards her music and image.","No

Reasoning: The user expresses sarcasm by saying they're ""sick"" about the comparison to the 1989 version, which suggests they find it offensive or inappropriate. This fits the definition of sarcasm as expressing an opposing viewpoint that doesn't align with the intended meaning.",1
mentally I’m hiding in the walk-in,"No

Reasoning: The phrase ""mentalism"" suggests hiding behind one's mental defenses rather than actively participating in it, which aligns more with sarcasm than exaggeration or ironic statements.","No

Reasoning:
The phrase ""mysteriously"" suggests an ironic twist or contradiction to the expected interpretation, which makes it more likely to be sarcastic than normal. The word ""hide"" is also typically used ironically in such contexts to imply hidden meaning or surprise. Therefore, this statement leans towards being sarcastic rather than just plain lying or exaggeratedly telling the truth.",1
i like starting conversations with “also” even though there was no proceeding sentence,"No

Reasoning:
This statement uses the phrase ""proceeding sentence,"" which implies that you're trying to get someone into an argument or discussion about a specific topic, rather than engaging in a constructive conversation. It's common for people to start conversations without explicitly stating an ongoing subject, especially when they want to initiate a discussion quickly. The use of ""also"" here is a play on words, suggesting both a continuation of the initial thought (which could be interpreted as a rhetorical question) and","No

Reasoning: The phrase ""also"" in this context suggests an attempt to start a discussion without providing any actual content, which could be seen as ironic or sarcastic if one assumes that someone is looking for more information on a topic before engaging in a conversation.

However, it's possible that the speaker might have had another idea or question they wanted to ask that wasn't mentioned at the beginning of their statement. Therefore, it doesn't necessarily mean it's a sarcastic response; rather,",0
We live in a society that has normalised debt as a part of our lifestyle. Let's normalise saving up our money before buying things.,"No

Reasoning: The argument assumes that everyone saves their money, which isn't necessarily true in every culture where it is expected to be done. Additionally, the assumption of a ""normalised"" society could be seen as an oversimplification if one doesn't consider other forms of debt like student loans.","No

Reasoning:
This statement is an extreme example of what can happen when people normalise borrowing without realizing it. It directly contradicts the idea of saving for future needs rather than using current funds to pay off debts. Therefore, this statement would be considered highly sarcastic because it challenges common financial practices.",0
"cannot believe i was at an actual gig tonight and now i’m on my way to an actual nightclub, truly feel like me again i am thriving","No

Reasoning: The speaker expresses happiness about attending their own gigs and planning to go to another one in the future, which suggests they feel content with their situation and not necessarily being ""thriving."" While it's possible this might indicate success in one area but also stress from other aspects, there seems to be some discrepancy between them feeling happy about themselves as people and actually doing well financially. This could be interpreted more broadly as someone who feels good overall despite having a negative financial outlook for the time","No

Reasoning:
This statement seems out of character for someone feeling ""thriving"" after attending a live performance, especially one that's not typical for them. It suggests a sense of failure or disappointment, which is usually more common in more mainstream environments rather than nightlife scenes where one might experience success or excitement.

However, it could be interpreted as a humorous comment about how people can forget about their current situation when they go back home after something significant has happened. This adds depth to the statement but",0
"FaceTimed with my parents last night while they were with my 6-year-old nephew. I’ve been missing him like crazy worried about being away from him for months, so I asked him if he remembers me. His response?
“I always will.” ❤️❤️❤️","No

Reasoning: The speaker mentions that they ""have been missing him"" and then asks if his parents remember them, implying that they don't have good communication about their children's whereabouts. This suggests sarcasm rather than irony or exaggeration.","No

Reasoning:
The use of the phrase ""I've been missing him like crazy"" implies that this was something significant that has been bothering or frustrating them, which could be seen as sarcasm rather than genuine concern. The statement itself doesn't inherently show sarcasm but the tone suggests it's a matter of frustration, which aligns more with an expression of annoyance rather than genuine concern.",0
@Jamie0Sharp Always ❤️,"No

Reasoning:
This message is clearly mocking Jamie 0 Sharp, which is an ironic response to his positive sentiment towards someone named Jamie. The use of ""Always ❤️"" (always) is not in line with the intended meaning of the original text and should be considered sarcastic.","No

Reasoning: The user responds in an ironic tone to a positive comment about Jamie Sharp (presumably referring to an American rapper), suggesting that they have not been impressed by his work since he moved to America. This aligns with the typical sarcastic reaction to someone's success in another culture, which could be interpreted as a form of mockery or sarcasm towards the author.",0
evERYTHING IS NOT A COMPETITION OF WHO HAD/HAS IT WORSE OK BYEEE,"No

Reasoning: The phrase ""EVERYTHING IS NOT A COMPETITION"" suggests that everything has equal value regardless of its impact or outcome, implying that no one should be held accountable for their actions based on how they affect others. This aligns well with the context provided in the text, which criticizes the idea that competition shouldn't exist as it would not benefit anyone but rather create chaos and conflict. Therefore, this text does not appear to be a sarcastic response but rather a","No

Reasoning:
This statement uses hyperbole and sarcasm to emphasize how everything deserves equal attention and importance, which can be interpreted as criticism or ridicule towards those who have done worse. The tone is mocking and dismissive, making it more likely to be seen as an insult rather than a sarcastic remark.",0
@cassieecote413 you can copy mine,"No

Reasoning: The quote ""you can copy mine"" suggests that the poster wants to be credited for their content, which isn't typically encouraged on social media platforms like this one. Therefore, it's likely sarcastic in nature.","No

Reasoning:
This message is clearly mocking or insulting someone else's work by taking credit for it without permission. It doesn't have sarcasm as defined in the context of using humor to make a point about copyright. Therefore, this text does not qualify as sarcastic according to our definition of sarcasm.",1
"Yesterday a stranger went into detail telling me how much better her new man is compared to her ex husband at oral sex, and it was a weird conversation but I guess I’m happy for her. New Year new mens.","No

Reasoning: The user expresses happiness about their relationship having improved in terms of sexual experiences over the course of the year, which implies they're not disappointed and would likely continue enjoying the experience. Therefore, this response fits more into a positive tone rather than an ironic one.","No

Reasoning:
This text is clearly mocking or sarcastically pointing out the negative aspects of someone's situation, which makes it an example of sarcasm rather than irony or exaggeration. The tone is dismissive, implying that such information should not be shared publicly or that people have been duped by this person.",0
I think I'm restarting my YouTube channel 🙊,"No

Reasoning:
This message is clearly mocking or jokingly suggesting that the user may be starting their YouTube channel anew, which would typically indicate sarcasm rather than an ironic suggestion about restarts.","No

Reasoning: The user mentions they're ""restarting"" their YouTube channel, which implies they're trying to get rid of it or clear its content for whatever reason, not because they're restarting it as in starting from zero again. This indicates sarcasm towards their past actions, suggesting they might be intentionally deleting the content or channels due to some internal conflict or change in plans.",0
